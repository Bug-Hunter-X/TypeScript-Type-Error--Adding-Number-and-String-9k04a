# TypeScript Type Error: Adding Number and String

This example demonstrates a type error that can occur in TypeScript when performing operations with incompatible types.  The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers, but the call to `add(1, '2')` passes a string as the second argument, resulting in a type error.

The solution involves improving type checking to prevent the error.
